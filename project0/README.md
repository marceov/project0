Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Hello!
This is my first project. There is you can find four pages which include some kind of little problem sets in first two lectures of CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course. Web address of this project is https://marceov.github.io. I put in this picture, table, list, class and id selectors, CSS properties, used bootstrap 4, links, practiced with source code of the lectures. Some bugs became features, for example on first page you can click any space around the picture to link, I wanted only pic) So Thank all the CS50 team for the Great opportunity to study computer science!
Thank you!
